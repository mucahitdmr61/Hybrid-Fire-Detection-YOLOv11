# 🛡️ Hybrid Fire & Smoke Detection (YOLOv11 + XGBoost)

This project is a high-performance fire and smoke detection system developed as a **Computer Engineering Design Project**. It combines deep learning (**YOLOv11**) for object localization with machine learning (**XGBoost**) for advanced feature verification to minimize false positives.

## 🧐 Problem & Solution
Standard object detection models can sometimes misinterpret bright lights as fire or fog as smoke. This hybrid approach solves this by:
1.  **Detection:** YOLOv11 identifies candidate regions (bounding boxes).
2.  **Feature Extraction:** Advanced features like **HSV Color Space**, **Laplacian Texture Analysis**, and **Geometric Aspects** are extracted from these regions.
3.  **Refinement:** An XGBoost-based hybrid layer analyzes these features to provide a final, highly accurate decision.



## 🛠️ Technologies
* **Python** 3.10+
* **YOLOv11** (Ultralytics)
* **XGBoost** (Gradient Boosting)
* **OpenCV** (Image Processing)
* **Scikit-learn** (Performance Metrics)

## 📊 Performance Analysis
The hybrid model significantly improves the detection reliability by filtering out environmental noise.

### 4. Live Inference Result (YOLO vs. Hybrid)
The power of the hybrid approach is clearly visible in the image below. While standard YOLOv11 might show lower confidence scores for smaller or occluded fires, our **XGBoost refinement layer** analyzes the HSV color and Laplacian texture features to provide a highly confident (**%99+**) final decision.
